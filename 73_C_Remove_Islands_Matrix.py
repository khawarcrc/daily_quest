# Outer loop explanation:
# The first loop in the `removeIslands` function scans through each cell on the border of the matrix.
# For any border cell containing a 1, it initiates a marking process to protect the connected 1's.
# This marking is done by changing 1's that are part of the border-connected regions to 2's.
# These marked 2's represent "safe" land cells that should not be removed, helping us to
# later distinguish between island cells (which need to be removed) and border-connected cells.

# Inner loop explanation:
# After marking the "safe" border-connected 1's, the second loop traverses all cells in the matrix.
# During this traversal, it checks each cell to identify and remove isolated 1's, also known as "islands."
# For each isolated 1 (a 1 not marked as connected to the border), it sets it to 0, effectively "removing" the island.
# The loop also reverts any 2's back to 1's, restoring the appearance of the matrix by keeping only the safe regions intact.

# Stack-based DFS explanation:
# The `changeOnesConnectedToBorderToTwos` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to mark all 1's connected to a given border cell.
# Using a stack, this function iterates over each connected 1 and marks it as 2, ensuring that all neighboring land cells are explored.
# This approach ensures that all border-connected land cells are marked in a single traversal without revisiting any cell.

# Neighbor retrieval explanation:
# The `getNeighbors` function gathers all valid neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) of a given cell.
# This is critical for the DFS traversal, as it ensures that only in-bound cells are processed.
# By providing a list of valid neighbors, it allows the DFS process to explore each connected cell efficiently.

# Border-Connected Cells Marking:
# In the first implementation, the function `findOnesConnectedToBorder` 
# marks cells connected to the border by using an auxiliary matrix, 
# `onesConnectedToBorder`, to track which cells are connected to the border.
# In the second implementation, the `changeOnesConnectedToBorderToTwos` 
# function directly modifies the matrix itself, marking border-connected cells 
# with the number 2, eliminating the need for an additional matrix.

# Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal:
# Both implementations use DFS to traverse connected cells, but they use 
# different helper functions:
# - The first implementation uses `findOnesConnectedToBorder` for recursive DFS traversal.
# - The second implementation uses a stack-based iterative approach within 
#   the `changeOnesConnectedToBorderToTwos` function.

# Final Conversion of Isolated 1's:
# - The first implementationâ€™s inner loop checks the `onesConnectedToBorder` 
#   matrix to determine which 1's to remove (set to 0).
# - The second implementation iterates over the matrix itself, converting 
#   unconnected 1's to 0 and reverting the marked 2's back to 1.

# Efficiency:
# - The second implementation is more space-efficient as it avoids using an 
#   auxiliary matrix and instead performs the marking directly within the 
#   original matrix. This reduces memory usage, potentially improving speed for 
#   large matrices.
# - Both implementations have the same time complexity since they both 
#   iterate over the matrix and process cells using DFS.
