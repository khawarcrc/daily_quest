Problem Statement:
------------------
You are tasked with implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. A BST is a data structure where each node has at most two children. The left child contains a value smaller than its parent node, and the right child contains a value larger than its parent node. The BST should allow the following operations:
  - Insert a key into the tree.
  - Check whether a key exists in the tree.
  - Delete a key from the tree.
  - Perform an inorder traversal to retrieve the keys in ascending order.

The challenge is to implement the BST efficiently, making sure that operations such as inserting, searching, and deleting have an average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees, and O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced trees).

Theory of Code:
---------------
1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Represents a single node in the tree.
   - Each node contains:
     - `key`: the value of the node.
     - `left`: pointer/reference to the left child (nodes with smaller keys).
     - `right`: pointer/reference to the right child (nodes with larger keys).
   - Each node starts with its left and right children set to `null`.

2. **BinarySearchTree Class**:
   - Represents the entire binary search tree, starting with an empty `root`.
   - The `root` is initially `null`, indicating that the tree is empty.

3. **Insert Operation**:
   - Goal: Add a new key into the BST while maintaining the BST properties.
   - Process:
     - If the tree is empty (`root` is `null`), the new key becomes the root.
     - Otherwise, we recursively find the correct location by comparing the key to the current node:
       - If the key is smaller than the current node's key, we move to the left subtree.
       - If the key is larger, we move to the right subtree.
     - If we reach a `null` node, we insert the new key at that position.
   - The recursion ensures that we traverse the tree in a binary search manner, either going left or right, making the operation efficient.

4. **Contains Operation**:
   - Goal: Check whether a specific key exists in the tree.
   - Process:
     - Starting from the root, we recursively compare the key with the current node's key:
       - If the key matches the current node's key, return `true` (key found).
       - If the key is smaller, move to the left subtree.
       - If the key is larger, move to the right subtree.
     - If we reach a `null` node, the key is not found, so return `false`.
   - This operation follows the same binary search principles as insertion.

5. **Delete Operation**:
   - Goal: Remove a key from the tree while maintaining the BST properties.
   - Process:
     - Recursively search for the key in the tree.
     - Once found, there are three possible cases for deletion:
       - **Case 1: Node has no children (leaf node)**:
         - Simply remove the node by returning `null` to its parent.
       - **Case 2: Node has one child**:
         - Replace the node with its child.
       - **Case 3: Node has two children**:
         - Find the inorder successor (the smallest node in the right subtree).
         - Replace the nodeâ€™s key with the successor's key.
         - Recursively delete the successor node.
   - The delete operation handles these cases efficiently while ensuring the tree remains a valid BST after deletion.

6. **_minValueNode Helper Method**:
   - This method is used to find the smallest node (inorder successor) in the right subtree during deletion.
   - The smallest node in a subtree is always the leftmost node, so we traverse to the leftmost child.

7. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - Goal: Retrieve all the keys in the BST in ascending order.
   - Process:
     - Traverse the tree in the following order:
       1. Visit the left subtree (smallest keys).
       2. Visit the current node (root of the subtree).
       3. Visit the right subtree (larger keys).
   - This traversal is performed recursively, and it guarantees that the keys are visited in ascending order.

8. **Private Methods (Underscore Prefix)**:
   - Methods like `_insert`, `_contains`, and `_delete` are prefixed with an underscore (`_`) to indicate they are private. This is a common convention in programming to signal that these methods should only be used internally by the class and not be accessed directly from outside the class.
   - JavaScript does not enforce private methods (unless using the newer `#` syntax), but this naming convention helps developers understand the intended usage of the method.

9. **Recursion**:
   - The insert, contains, and delete operations are all implemented using recursion.
   - Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the problem, which allows us to traverse the tree by moving left or right at each step.
   - Each recursive call operates on a smaller part of the tree (either the left or right subtree) until we reach the base case (a `null` node or finding the correct node).

10. **Edge Cases**:
   - Insertion, search, and deletion handle various edge cases:
     - Inserting a key into an empty tree.
     - Searching for a key that doesn't exist.
     - Deleting nodes with zero, one, or two children.
     - Deleting the root node or other internal nodes.
     - Ensuring that the BST properties are maintained after any operation.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- **Insert**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
- **Contains**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
- **Delete**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
- **Inorder Traversal**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (since each node is visited once).

Summary:
--------
This code implements a binary search tree in JavaScript with key operations like insertion,
 searching, deletion, and inorder traversal. Recursion is heavily used to traverse the tree,
  and edge cases like handling empty trees and node deletions are efficiently managed. 
  The use of private methods (via underscore convention) helps separate internal logic from public API methods.
