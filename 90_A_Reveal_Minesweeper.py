 # ---------------------- Problem Statement & Execution Theory ----------------------
# '''
# Problem Statement:
# You are given a 2D board representing a Minesweeper game. Each cell can be:
# - 'H' (Hidden)
# - 'M' (Mine)
# - '0'â€“'8' (Revealed number indicating how many adjacent mines exist)

# You are given a starting point (row, coloumn) where the user clicks.
# If the cell is a mine ('M'), return the board as it is.
# If it's not a mine:
#   - Count adjacent mines.
#   - If at least one mine is adjacent, reveal the count.
#   - If no adjacent mines, reveal it as '0' and recursively reveal all hidden neighbors.

# Execution Theory:
# 1. Check if the clicked cell is a mine. If yes, return board unchanged.
# 2. Get all 8-directional neighbors using `getNeighbors`.
# 3. Count how many neighbors are mines.
# 4. If mines exist, set the current cell to the count.
# 5. If no mines, mark it '0' and recursively reveal all hidden neighbors.
