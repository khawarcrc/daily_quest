# Problem Statement:
# Implement a doubly linked list data structure in Python.
# A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a value 
# and two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. 
# This allows traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

# Theory:
# 1. **Node Structure:**
#    - Each node in the doubly linked list contains three attributes:
#      - `value`: Stores the data of the node.
#      - `next`: Points to the next node in the list.
#      - `prev`: Points to the previous node in the list.
#    - The `next` pointer of the last node is set to `None`.
#    - The `prev` pointer of the first node is set to `None`.

# 2. **Doubly Linked List Structure:**
#    - The doubly linked list contains two attributes:
#      - `head`: Points to the first node in the list.
#      - `tail`: Points to the last node in the list.
#    - If the list is empty, both `head` and `tail` are `None`.

# 3. **Operations on Doubly Linked List:**
#    - **Insertion**:
#      - At the beginning: Add a new node before the current `head` and update the `head`.
#      - At the end: Add a new node after the current `tail` and update the `tail`.
#      - At a specific position: Traverse to the desired position, update pointers to insert the new node.

#    - **Deletion**:
#      - From the beginning: Remove the `head` node and update the `head` to the next node.
#      - From the end: Remove the `tail` node and update the `tail` to the previous node.
#      - From a specific position: Traverse to the desired position and update pointers to remove the node.

#    - **Traversal**:
#      - Forward Traversal: Start from the `head` and move through the `next` pointers until `None`.
#      - Backward Traversal: Start from the `tail` and move through the `prev` pointers until `None`.

#    - **Search**:
#      - Traverse the list to find a node with a specific value.
#      - Return the position of the node or indicate that it is not found.

#    - **Update**:
#      - Traverse the list to find a node with a specific value.
#      - Update the value of the node.

# 4. **Edge Cases**:
#    - Insertion into an empty list.
#    - Deletion from an empty list.
#    - Deleting a node that doesnâ€™t exist.
#    - Traversing an empty list.
#    - Handling `None` values for `next` and `prev` pointers during insertion and deletion.

# 5. **Time Complexity Analysis**:
#    - **Insertion**:
#      - At the beginning: O(1)
#      - At the end: O(1)
#      - At a specific position: O(n) in the worst case due to traversal.
#    - **Deletion**:
#      - From the beginning: O(1)
#      - From the end: O(1)
#      - From a specific position: O(n) in the worst case due to traversal.
#    - **Traversal**: O(n) for both forward and backward traversal.
#    - **Search**: O(n) in the worst case as it requires traversal of the list.
#    - **Update**: O(n) in the worst case due to traversal.
