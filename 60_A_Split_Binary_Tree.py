# Problem Statement:
# ------------------
# Given a binary tree, the goal is to determine if it can be split into two subtrees
# with equal sums. If such a split is possible, return the sum of each resulting subtree;
# otherwise, return 0. A "split" in this context means that one of the subtrees has a sum
# equal to exactly half the total sum of the entire tree.
#
# Approach:
# ---------
# 1. First, calculate the total sum of all nodes in the tree using a helper function (`getTreeSum`).
#    If this sum is odd, it's impossible to split the tree into two equal parts, so return 0 immediately.
# 2. If the sum is even, we proceed with a target split sum, which is half the total.
# 3. The `trySubTrees` function is used to traverse the tree recursively, calculating the sum of each subtree
#    to see if any subtreeâ€™s sum equals the target split sum.
# 4. During traversal, each node's subtree sum (including itself) is calculated, and a check is performed
#    to see if it matches the target split sum.
# 5. If such a subtree is found, the function returns `True` indicating the tree can be split, and
#    the main function returns the target split sum. Otherwise, it returns 0, meaning no equal split is possible.
