# Problem Statement:
# Given a sorted array, construct a Binary Search Tree (BST) such that the tree has minimal height.
# A BST is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than all the nodes in its left subtree 
# and smaller than all the nodes in its right subtree. The goal is to maintain balance in the tree by 
# ensuring that the treeâ€™s height is as small as possible.
# This is achieved by selecting the middle element of the current (sub)array as the root or subtree root 
# during each recursive step to divide the array into two halves: left and right subtrees.

# Approach for Current Code:
# 1. The `minHeightBst` function initializes the process by calling the `constructMinHeightBst` function 
#    with the entire array and appropriate start and end indices.
# 
# 2. In `constructMinHeightBst`, the middle element of the current subarray is selected and becomes the root 
#    (or subtree root) to maintain a balanced tree structure.
# 
# 3. The function recursively constructs the left and right subtrees by assigning the left subtree to 
#    `bst.left` and the right subtree to `bst.right`. This is done by recursively calling 
#    `constructMinHeightBst` for the left and right halves of the array.
#
# 4. The base case occurs when the start index becomes greater than the end index, meaning there are no more 
#    elements to process in that subarray, and the recursion terminates.
#
# 5. The final result is a balanced BST with minimal height, where the root is the middle element of the 
#    array, and each subtree is similarly balanced by recursively selecting middle elements.
